Roaming Safety Robot misc code for Raspberry Pi, a motor hat, camera, Respeaker, and Intel Neural Compute Stick

These are code snipets with original code by CaptStephan and publicly available code from github users (named in the code files). Some code from Intel for use with the Neural Compute Stick. Some code from hardware vendors that came with the hardware used on the demo bot.

This is a very crude file set and my first github repo.
